    "\n",
    "- 2 billion TFT maximum\n",
    "    - difficulty level gets adjusted in line with nr of total TFT to make sure we can never get above 2billion\n",
    "    - 50% of cultivated tokens (means capacity bought by users): get's burned\n",
    "        - this means that by using the capcacity tokens get destroyed leaving more room for new farmers\n",
